# Newsbot

Newsbot is a project designed to become your home, for news.  This project has grown in the last couple years I have been working on it.  Start out as a python project but now is golang microservices.

## Components

- [collector.api](https://github.com/jtom38/newsbot.collector.api)
  - This will go out and collect from different news sources and send out notifications when matches are found.
- [portal](https://github.com/jtom38/newsbot.portal)
  - This is the web ui to view/edit the service

## Roadmap

**This is subject to change but will give an idea of where the project is going.**
